# React Weather App
PURPOSE: React Project that uses React.js to show a nice represenation of the weather.

This a simple React Weahter Application that allows you to look up any exisiting city around the world to find out about their weather. The service that provided me the api's for the weather was OpenWeatherMap. Simply enter a city and country and it will show you temperature, area, conditions, and other useful information. NOTE: You can abbreviate the country meaning United States could also input as us or US in the search box. Future implmentation would be adding a hourly forcast of your current weather search.
